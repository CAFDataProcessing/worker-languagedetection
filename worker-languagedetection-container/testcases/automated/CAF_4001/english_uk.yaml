     - data: The EU's latest Earth observer, Sentinel-2a, has gone operational. Users are now able to download its images of the planet, although they will need to register first. The Sentinel, which has been undergoing in-orbit testing since its launch back in June, views the land surface in optical and infrared light. Its pictures will be used by scientists to track everything from the growth of megacities to the variable yields of the world's most important food crops. And researchers will, of course, use 2a's acquisitions prominently in climate studies (examples are being shown at the COP21 talks in Paris). But the EU's free and open data policy means anyone can now download and play with the images. The EU and Esa have been showcasing the work of the Sentinel series of satellites at the climate summit (COP21) this past week in Paris And unlike the products from some specialist satellites, which are hard to interpret - the colour views from Sentinel-2a should appeal to a very broad audience. The European Space Agency (Esa), which manages the satellite for the EU, expects demand to be huge. Already, many thousands of users have registered to make Sentinel downloads - and these were people who were predominantly after the more complex radar pictures being produced by another spacecraft in the series, Sentinel-1a.
