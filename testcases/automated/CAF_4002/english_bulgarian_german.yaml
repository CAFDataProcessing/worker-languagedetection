     - data: The steep cost of incarceration on women of color For Debra Henderson, love has come with a hefty price tag. Her ex-husband was incarcerated multiple times, her boyfriend was recently released after serving seven months for a felony and her son has had a few brushes with the law. In all, Henderson, who is 40 and makes $60,000 a year working at an insurance company, has spent more than $32,000 on everything from bail bonds to lawyers to phone calls trying to maintain relationships with the men in her life. Henderson is one of thousands of women who are shouldering the financial burden of incarceration of a loved one, particularly in black communities. According to data from a CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll on race in America, 55% of black Americans said they either had been incarcerated themselves or had a close friend or family member who had been incarcerated compared to 36% of whites and 39% of Hispanics. Among these black Americans, nearly two-thirds said they earned less than $50,000 a year and only 21% said they had earned a college degree. The financial costs of incarceration are steep. Inmates can be assessed fees for their daily stay in jail, probation and phone calls. In some cases, inmates accrued thousands of dollars in prison-related debt. Once released, many former inmates find that employers are reluctant to hire people with criminal records. As a result, it's often female relatives who are left footing a large percentage of the bills. race reality families inmates big number 2 "Women of color are carrying the burden," said Gale Muhammad, the founder and president of the prison advocacy group Women Who Never Give Up. "It's all on us, the mothers, the wives, the sisters, the girlfriends." Indeed, research on the financial costs of incarceration by the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in 2014 showed that 83% of family members responsible for court-related costs were women. Families surveyed in the report also said they had trouble meeting basic needs like food, housing, utilities and transportation after a loved one was incarcerated. The economic costs of loving someone in prison "has broken the black family," Muhammad said. "You've got women working two or three jobs to keep it together." Henderson's troubles began with her ex-husband, who she met when she was 16. During their 15-year relationship they had three children and he was in and out of prison. Once she gave him $5,000 to help pay for a lawyer. Then she helped pay for phone calls and sent him money for his commissary account and visited him in jail, spending money on gas, tolls and vending machine food. In 2007, she had just refinanced the house they lived in when her husband was arrested again. The $10,000 she received from the refinancing went to a bail bondsman instead. "That money was supposed to be used to fix my home," Henderson said. It was the last straw and the couple separated shortly thereafter. She never received child support from her ex-husband, who is currently incarcerated, and now that two of her children are above the age of 18 and the youngest is 14, she doesn't expect she will. In March 2012, Henderson declared bankruptcy. race reality families inmates debbie  Debra Henderson has spent more than $32,000 on everything from bail bonds to prison phone calls. But Henderson's financial woes didn't stop there. In August 2014, Henderson's current boyfriend landed in jail. Henderson said she spent $2,450 on phone calls with her boyfriend during his seven-month stint. In October, the Federal Communications Commission ruled to cap the cost of phone calls made between prisoners and their families, which had become prohibitively expensive. But for Henderson, the ruling came too late.  Мая Манолова има намерение през следващата година да извърши цялостна реформа в институцията омбудсман. Това обяви тя на обзорна пресконференция, на която отчете свършеното за двата месеца откакто е на поста.  Първият нов момент е организирането на пет постоянно действащи приемни в икономическите райони за планиране. Целта е омбусманът да е по-близо да гражданите. Като аргумент Манолова изтъкна, че има хора, за които пътуването до София или до областния център е финансов проблем.  Бившият червен депутат предвижда и нещо като десанти в страната, като при визитите в една област няма да се ходи само в областния град. Амбицията е експертите на институцията да отидат до всяка община.  Манолова отчете, че за два месеца при омбудсмана са постъпили 1622 жалби срещу 1006 за същия период през миналата година. Без да коментира причините, омбудсманът подчерта, че нарастването на броя на жалбите е показател за повишените очакванията към институцията  Мая Манолова посочи, че до момента е изготвила 74 препоръки до министри, началници на различни институции и кметове. "С част от тях лицата, които сме ги отправили, са се съобразили. В други случаи се налага да пишем повторно", обясни тя, цитирана от "Фокус".  Омбудсманът обяви, че днес ще бъде внесена първата и конституционна жалба. Тя е свързана със Закона за акцизите и данъчните складове.  Манолова уточни, че жалбата е в защита на собственици на малки обекти за дестилиране на спиртни напитки. До момента при омбудсмана са постъпили 13 искания от граждани и организация за сезирането на Конституционния съд, като за четири има отказ, а останалите седем са в процес на обработване.  Bereits an diesem Mittwoch hat Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel im Bundestag die erste Regierungserklärung ihrer neuen Amtszeit abgegeben. Es ging allerdings um den bevorstehenden EU-Gipfel in Brüssel, bei dem es um eine gemeinsame Sicherheitspolitik gehen soll. Ein Ausblick auf das schwarz-rote Gesamtprogrammlässt noch auf sich warten.  Am Nachmittag fliegt sie dann gemeinsam mit Außenminister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) zu einem Besuch nach Paris. Steinmeier selbst unternimmt seine erste Solo-Reise am Donnerstag nach Warschau. Bei dem Treffen in Brüssel sollten auch Vorentscheidungen über nächste Schritte in der Erweiterungspolitik getroffen werden, sagten Diplomaten.
