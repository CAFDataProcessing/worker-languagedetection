At that moment a young man came into the bunkhouse; a thin young man with a brown face, with
brown eyes and a head of tightly curled hair. He wore a work glove on his left hand, and like the boss,
he wore high-heeled boots. ‘Seen my old man?’ he asked.
The swamper said: ‘He was here jus’ a minute ago, Curley. Went over to the cook-house, I think.’
‘I’ll try to catch him,’ said Curley. His eyes passed over the new men and he stopped. He glanced
coldly at George and then at Lennie. His arms gradually bent at the elbows and his hands closed into
fists. He stiffened and went into a slight crouch. His glance was at once calculating and pugnacious.
Lennie squirmed under the look and shifted his feet nervously. Curley stepped gingerly close to him.
‘You the new guys the old man was waitin’ for?’
‘We just come in,’ said George.
‘Let the big guy talk.’
Lennie twisted with embarrassment.
George said: ‘S’pose he don’t want to talk?’
Curley lashed his body around. ‘By Christ, he’s gotta talk when he’s spoke to. What the hell are you
gettin’ into it for?’
‘We travel together,’ said George coldly.
‘Oh, so it’s that way.’
George was tense and motionless. ‘Yeah, it’s that way.’
Lennie was looking helplessly to George for instruction.
‘An’ you won’t let the big guy talk, is that it?’
‘He can talk if he want to tell you anything.’ He nodded slightly to Lennie.
‘We jus’ come in,’ said Lennie softly.
Curley stared levelly at him. ‘Well, nex’ time you answer when you’re spoke to.’ He turned towards
the door and walked out, and his elbows were still bent out a little.
Sam interrupted, a sly grin curling the corners of his mouth: ‘Yow don’t do nothing but talk, “Uncle”.
And give everything away to some darkies we’ve never met. We don’t give a toss for anybody else.
This is our patch. Not some wogs’ handout.’
I felt as if I had been punched in the stomach. My legs felt watery and a hot panic softened my
insides to mush. It was as if the whole crowd had turned into one huge eyeball which swivelled slowly
between me and papa. I wished I had stood next to papa; I could feel Anita shifting beside me, I knew
she would not hold me or take my hand. Papa was staring into the distance, seemingly unconcerned,
gripping his bottle of whisky like a weapon. Uncle Alan’s mouth was opening and closing like a
goldfish, Reverend Ince whispered to him ‘Good work, Alan. One of your supporters, is he?’
And then a rasping voice came from somewhere in the throng, ‘You tell him, son.’
I jerked my head towards the sound. Who was that? Who said that? Who had thought that all this
time and why had I never known about it? And then another voice, a woman’s, ‘Go on, lad! Tell him
some more!’ The sound had come from somewhere around Mr Ormerod, I stared at him, straight into
his eyes. He shifted from foot to foot and glanced away.
My mind was turning cartwheels; I wanted to find these people, tell them Sam Lowbridge was my
mate, the boy who had taught me how to shoot a fairground rifle, who terrorised everyone else except
me. I was his favourite. There must have been some mistake. When my ears had stopped ringing and I
gradually returned to my body, I could hear catcalls coming from all over the grounds; ‘Yow shuttit,
yow bloody skinhead idiot! Bloody disgrace, Sam Lowbridge! Yow wanna good birching, yow do! Yow
don’t talk for me, son! I’d be on my deathbed before that’d happen!’
Uncle Alan was half-running towards the gate, towards Sam who was strolling back to his moped to
the cheers and claps of his gang. ‘Wait! Sam!’ Uncle Alan puffed. ‘Listen! Don’t do this! Don’t turn all
this energy the wrong way!’ Sam was not listening. He was already revving up, clouds of bluey-grey
smoke wheezing from his exhaust. ‘Anger is good! But not used this way! Please! You’re going the
wrong way!’
Sam aimed his moped straight at Uncle Alan who was now outside the gates, making him jump back
and stumble, and then he sped off up the hill followed by the rest of his three-wheeler lackeys, who
manoeuvred in and out of each other like a bunch of May-mad midges until they were nothing but
annoying buzzy specks in the distance. Uncle Alan sat heavily down on the grass and rested his head on
his arms. People were now crowding round papa, offering condolences and back pats like he’d just
come last in the annual church egg and spoon race. ‘Yow don’t mind him, Mr Ku-mar, he’s always been
a bad-un . . .’ Papa smiled graciously at them, shrugging his shoulders, not wanting to draw any more
attention to himself or what had just happened. I knew he was trying to get to me and I began pushing
forward, encountering a wall of solid backs and legs.
Anita was tugging my sleeve as she held onto me. I turned round to face her, my cheeks still felt
warm and taut. ‘Wharrabout that then!’ she grinned, ‘Isn’t he bosting!’
‘What?’ I croaked.
‘Sam Lowbridge, He’s dead bloody hard, in’t he?’
‘Anita Rutter, yow am a bloody stupid cow sometimes,’ I said, and did not look back until I had
reached the haven of papa’s arms.
